Bits, bytes, and words are fundamental units in computing. A bit is the smallest unit, representing 0 or 1.  A byte is a group of 8 bits, often storing a single character. A word is a group of bytes, and its size depends on the computer's architecture.  16-bit systems typically have 2-byte words, 32-bit systems have 4-byte words, and 64-bit systems have 8-byte words.  Larger word sizes allow the CPU to process more data simultaneously, generally improving performance, especially for memory-intensive tasks.  Word size is crucial for software design and compatibility, as it dictates how data is handled and addressed in memory.  Modern computers predominantly use 64-bit architectures due to their ability to handle larger datasets and execute complex operations efficiently.
